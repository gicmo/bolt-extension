# Bolt Extension

## A gnome-shell (< 3.28) extension to bolt

This extension acts as the authorization agent for `boltd`,
the system daemon of the [bolt][bolt]. It will automatically
authorize new thunderbolt devices if the user is logged in.

**NB** It is included in gnome-shell version 3.28 (and later) so it is
**NOT** needed anymore. This is the extracted version of gnome-shell's
3.28 thunderbolt status indicator.
